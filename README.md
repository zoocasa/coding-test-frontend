# Instructions

Format: a 45 min pair programming session followed by 15 minutes of discussion and feedback.

Goal: Demonstrate an understanding of React and NextJS by adding new UI features based on spec as well as refactoring and implementing common NextJS application features.

Preparation: Candidate should have a NextJS development environment up and running on their local machine (https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) including NodeJS v16 or higher and yarn package manager as well as have this repository downloaded and running locally.

Notes & Tips: We're simulating a regular work day so the candidate is allowed to Google anything during the test (we don't expect you to have syntax memorized). The most successful candidates share their thoughts as they work, what ideas they have and what they're trying to do. If your IDE supports it, using a split editor/panel with /pages/index.tsx on the left and Home.module.scss on the right makes it easier to implement and style your UI while we work.

# Getting started
1. Download this git repository to candidate's machine
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dev`
