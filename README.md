# Instructions

Format: a 45 min pair programming session followed by 15 minutes of discussion and feedback.

Goal: We're going to be creating some new UI in React/NextJS website based on a spec.

Preparation: Candidate should have a NextJS development environment up and running on their local machine (https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) including NodeJS v16 or higher and yarn package manager.

Notes & Tips: We're simulating a regular work day so the candidate is allowed to Google anything during the test (we don't expect you to have syntax memorized). The most successful candidates share their thoughts as they work, what ideas they have and what they're trying to do. If your IDE supports it, using a split editor/panel with /pages/index.tsx on the left and Home.module.scss on the right makes it easier to implement and style your UI while we work.

# Getting started
1. Download this git repository to candidate's machine
2. Run "yarn install"
3. Run "yarn dev"
