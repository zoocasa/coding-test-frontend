# Zoocasa Coding Test (Next.js)

## Instructions
**Format:** a 45-minute pair-programming session followed by 15 minutes of discussion and feedback.

**Goal:** Demonstrate an understanding of Next.js and React by adding new UI features based on a spec, as well as refactoring and implementing common Next.js application features.

**Preparation:** You should have a Next.js development environment up and running on your local machine, including **Node.js v16** or higher and the **yarn** package manager. Please ensure this repository is downloaded and running locally before the session begins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're simulating a regular work day so the candidate is allowed to Google anything during the test (we don't expect you to have syntax memorized). If you use an IDE with AI (such as Cursor) be prepared to explain any generated code and why it does or does not work. The most successful candidates share their thoughts as they work, discussing their ideas and what they're trying to do. 

## Setup
### Prerequisites
* Node.js v16+
* Yarn package manager

### Getting Started
1.  Clone this repository to your machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4.  Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

> [!TIP]
> Having the app set up and running locally in an IDE you're comfortable with will set you up for success! 
> If your IDE supports it, using a split editor/panel with `/pages/index.tsx` on the left and `Home.module.scss` on the right can make it easier to implement and style your UI as we work.
